# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Using-Streamlit
## Task
Write a code to deploy Multiple Disease Prediction model using **Streamlit**</br>
Tool Used: </br>
Anaconda Navigator, Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, Python
## Workflow
### Libraries:
Libraries needed to achieve the task:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Pickle: Library used to save and load the model 
- Streamlit(pip install streamlit)
- streamlit_option_menu 

### Process
- Save the build model to a file in binary format using pickle's dump function
- Load all the saved model into **Spyder** file.
- Create the sidebar using "Streamlit option menu"
- Create the page for each disease separetely
  
### Steps to run the code
- Requirement: Install all the Necessary tools and Libraries mentioned above
- Open the terminal of Anconda Navigator and type **streamlit run "File_path including name"** and our default webpage would be loaded with basic page with input text and buttons. (Path I used to run the file is added with repo)
- Created model in also added with repo
- Jupyter file for the main model building and loading is included to show the usage of pickle function
- A preview of web page screeenshot for Streamlit can be checked in the repo</br></br></br>
